# dfx

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Reference"]} />


When invoked as `dfx`, `dfxvm` determines which version of dfx to use
and dispatches execution to it.

## dfx version determination

`dfxvm` determines which version of dfx to use by checking these criteria
in order:

1. `+<version>` parameter from command line
2. `DFX_VERSION` environment variable
3. `dfx` in the current project's `dfx.json`
4. `default_version` in `$HOME/.config/dfx/version-manager.json`

### Command Line

You can specify the version of dfx to use on the command line by passing
`+<version>` as the first parameter. For example, the following will deploy
using dfx 0.15.0:

```bash
dfx +0.15.0 deploy
```

### DFX_VERSION environment variable

You can specify the version of dfx to use by setting the `DFX_VERSION`
environment variable.  For example, the following will start the replica using
dfx 0.15.0:

```bash
DFX_VERSION=0.15.0 dfx start --clean --background
```

### dfx field in the current project's dfx.json

If running dfxvm as dfx in a dfx project, and the project's dfx.json contains a
top-level field "dfx", then dfxvm will use the version specified in that field.

Like dfx, dfxvm looks for dfx.json in the current directory and then in
parent directories until it finds one or reaches the root directory.

For example:

```json
{
  "dfx": "0.14.4",
  "canisters": {  }
}
```

If the above dfx.json were in the current directory or any parent directory,
then any dfx command would use dfx 0.14.4.

### default_version in $HOME/.config/dfx/version-manager.json

If none of the above criteria are met, then dfxvm will use the version specified
in `$HOME/.config/dfx/version-manager.json`. For example:

```json
{
  "default_version": "0.15.0"
}
```

To configure the default dfx version, use the `dfxvm default` command:

```bash
dfxvm default 0.15.1
```

## Environment Variables

When proxying to dfx, dfxvm alters the environment in two ways:
- Sets `DFX_VERSION` to the version of dfx being used.
- Prepends the bin directory for the dfx version to `PATH`.
